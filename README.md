# COMOL-1-The-COBOL-Wavetable-Synthesizer
This is a highly flexible and versatile wavetable synthesizer written entirely in COBOL. In the long term, I aim to develop this project to create a program that fully emulates the time variable control system of the Roland JD800, but with more user customizability  in the selection and editing of waveforms.
