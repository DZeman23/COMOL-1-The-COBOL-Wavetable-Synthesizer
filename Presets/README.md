# Presets
I have implemented a preset system. Instead of creating the presets manually, just load the init files from the windows generated by the python autorun script. That way, you can load the sound instantly with no hassle. Load COMOL-1 first, generate the sounds, then load and generate the stereo FX through the FX module. Make sure that the FX module is processing the sounds you just generated

## Important 
File paths are still hardcoded, evein in the ini files. Please don't forget to update your paths if you want to use the preset files
